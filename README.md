# Snek

A simple JavaScript implementation of the classic Snake game.

## Playing

Open `index.html` in your browser or enable GitHub Pages on this repository to play online.

Use the arrow keys or WASD keys to control the snake. Eat the red dots scattered around the board to grow longer and increase your score. The snake wraps around when it reaches the edge of the board. If you collide with yourself the game restarts.
Hold the spacebar to temporarily speed up the snake. Press <kbd>p</kbd> to pause or resume the game.

Your highest scores are stored locally and displayed in the leaderboard below the game. Try to beat your personal best!

Enjoy!
